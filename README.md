> This is a modified version of the original rgmc (RG, CGGC_RG, CGGCi_RG clustering
algorithms) extended with additional I/O formats and some minor fixes (mainly in
the I/O): full support of the official Metis format of the input graph, refined
parsing of the Pajek, added NSL input format and CNL output format to be applicable
in the [PyCABeM clustering benchmark](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM).
The core algorithm itself is untouched (though, the implementation is not
optimal).

# Deployment
## Dependencies
Boost program options library (v. >= 1.42)
"sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev"

## Compilation
`$ make [release|debug]`  
Compiler/Linker errors are most likely due to incorrect settings of include and lib paths.  

# Usage
Run rgmc with the following parameters:
```
$ ./rgmc -h
Performs clustering of the unweighed undirected network (graph) using RG, CGGC_RG or CGGCi_RG algorithms.

Supported Arguments:
  -h [ --help ]                   Display this message
  -i [ --inpfmt ] arg (=)        input network format (inferred from the file
                                  extension if not specified explicitly):
                                  e - nse format: header in comments + each
                                  line specifies a single edge: <sid> <did>,
                                  a - nse format: header in comments + each
                                  line specifies a single arc: <sid> <did>,
                                  m - Metis format of the unweighted network,
                                  p - Pajek format of the undirected unweighted
                                  network
  -s [ --startk ] arg (=2)        sample size of RG
  -f [ --finalk ] arg (=2000)     sample size for final RG step
  -r [ --runs ] arg (=1)          number of runs from which to pick the best
                                  result
  -e [ --ensemblesize ] arg (=-1) size of ensemble for ensemble algorithms (-1
                                  = ln(#vertices))
  -a [ --algorithm ] arg (=3)     algorithm: 1: RG, 2: CGGC_RG, 3: CGGCi_RG
  -o [ --outfmt ] arg (=l)        output clusters format:
                                  l - cnl format: header in comments + each
                                  line corresponds to the cluster and contains
                                  ids of the member vertices,
                                  c - each line corresponds to the cluster and
                                  contains ids of the member vertices,
                                  v - each line corresponds to the vertex and
                                  contains id of the owner cluster
  -f [ --outfile ] arg            file to store the detected communities
  -d [ --seed ] arg               seed value to initialize random number
                                  generator
```

For example:
```
$ rgmc --algorithm=2 --outfile=test.out test.graph
runs the CGGC_RG algorithm on the graph test.graph and writes the results to
test.out
```
or just `$ rgmc email.graph`.

## Input
The undirected unweighted input network to be clustered can be specified in the NSL (nsa/nse), [Metis graph](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/metis_graph/metis_graph.html) or [Pajek network](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/pajek-net-format/) (using only `*Edges`) formats.

NSL format (nsa - arcs, directed network; nse - edges, undirected network) specifies network links in each line of the file as node ids separated by the space delimiter with optional `#` line comments and an optional header:
```
# Example Network .nse (edges - undirected)
# Nodes: 3  Edges: 3   Weighted: 0
# Note that the number of links corresponds to the number of payload lines in the file
0 1
# Empty lines and comments are allowed
0 2
2 1
```

## Output
The CNL (clusters nodes list) output is the default and standard output format, generalization of the Stanford SNAP ground-truth communities. It is an input format for various NMI-evaluation algorithms. Each line of the file corresponds to the single resulting cluster, where member nodes are specified separated by the space/tab with optional share. For example:
```
# Clusters: 2, Nodes: 5, Fuzzy: 0
0
1 3 2 4
```
The clusters output for each vertex is also supported.
